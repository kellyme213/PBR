Download the Xcode project, compile, and run. Currently, you should see a Cornell box appear on screen. You can more the camera by clicking and dragging on the screen, and use WASDQE for movement along the six axes. Press the space bar to move back to the original position. Press R to transition between the rasterized render and path traced render.
